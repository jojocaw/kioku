"""The habits that make memory grow: day → week → month → topic notes → index.

- daily_journal   (nightly, Lightning)   the day's conversation + saved notes → daily note; topic histories
- weekly_review   (Sunday, Super)        the week's daily notes → weekly note; topic "current state"; index facts
- monthly_review  (1st of month, Super)  the month's weekly notes → monthly note
- morning_briefing (morning, Lightning)  yesterday's open threads + tasks + on-this-day → a short briefing

Each skill asks for JSON and renders the Markdown itself, so the notes keep the same shape every day.
All model calls go through the guard (budget, redaction, receipts).
